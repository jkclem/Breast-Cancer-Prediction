# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This project was completed by Shantel Ward, Rong Huang, and John Clements. 

We examined Doctor's assessments of fine needle aspirations of breast masses, which rated aspects of the masses as more benign or more malignant. 

We used Hoetelling's T^2 test to establish differences between benign and malignant breast masses. 

We then used PCA to find a lower dimensional representation of the data set and examined the weights of the principal components.

Finally, we used cross-validation to select a machine learning classifier and tested its performance on a withheld testing data set.

Improvements to README.md: Better summary and data description.
